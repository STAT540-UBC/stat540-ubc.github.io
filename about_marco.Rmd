## Teaching Assistant

**Pronouns**: He/Him/His  
**Virtual office hours**: Thurs 11am-12pm (Pacific time)

I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics, and I work at BC Children's Hospital Research Institute. I finished the undergraduate program in Genomic Sciences from the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) before joining the Korthauer Lab in 2020. I have always been interested in gene regulation dynamics; my current work is focused on unraveling the effects of DNA methylation in gene expression using publicly available data. In my free time, I like painting, swimming, and playing videogames/boardgames.
