## Instructor

**Pronouns**: He/Him/His
**Virtual office hours**: By appointment

I am a computational biologist. My research focuses on developing scalable probabilistic inference methods to elucidate hidden causal mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer and other common/complex disorders. For teaching, I am always grateful to my teachers and mentors, from whom I learned bioinformatics, computational modelling, Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and scientific research methods. 

I am a coffee enthusiast. I also enjoy drawing and bird watching.
