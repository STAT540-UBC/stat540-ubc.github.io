## Teaching Assistant

**Pronouns**: She/Her/Hers
**Office hours**: By Appointment

I am a PhD student in the Department of Bioinformatics at UBC, supervised by Dr. Paul Pavlidis.
My research focuses on discovering cell-type specific signals of gene expression in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. 
In my free time you can find me at the gym, in the mountains or at the beach.
