Grade point values are listed in the assignment.\nThe instructions and questions are available here.\nSeminar participation (30%)\nYou will submit short “deliverables” to demonstrate your participation for every seminar. These deliverables give practical experience applying the knowledge that will be helpful on homework, the project, and your future research. Each Seminar session is weighted equally, but the lowest score will be dropped. Seminar deliverables are due on the next Tuesday following the TA-led session for that seminar. See the Seminars page for the submission materials and schedule.\nPaper critique (5%)\nEach student will review and provide a written critique (max 1000 words) of a paper that will be posted on Canvas.\nPlease see critique rubric for detailed instructions on this task.\nAnalysis assignment (20%)\nThis assignment will assess your understanding of the seminar and lecture materials. Start early because this assignment will take time to fully work through. Use the issues in the Discussion repo and the seminar time to ask questions. You will find most of the analysis workflow of the assignment in the seminar materials.\nThe instruction and questions will be available here.\nThe grade point values for each question are listed right in the assignment.\nFinal group project (40%)\nGeneral principles\nIdentify a biological question of interest and a relevant dataset. Develop and apply a statistical approach that allows you to use the dataset to answer the question.\nWe assume the biological question and data fall in the general area of high-throughput, large-scale biological investigations targeted by the course. Beyond that, it is wide open: methylation, SNPs, miRNAs, CNVs, RNA-Seq, CHiP-Seq, gene networks, … it’s fair game. Avoid a dataset that doesn’t have any/much quantitative data, i.e. contains only sequence or discrete data. If you are using published data, it is critical to be clear about how your project differs from previous literature.\nNote that definitive answers are not necessarily expected. Rather, aim to provide a critical appraisal of the data, the analytical approach, and the results. You will have to handle the competing pressures to “get it right” and “get it done”. Shortcomings of the data, misfits between the data or the biological question and the statistical model, etc. are inevitable. Your goal is to identify such issues and discuss them critically, without becoming paralyzed. Demonstrate understanding of the statistical concepts and methods that are the foundation of your analytical approach.\nWe assume the analytical and computing task will have a substantial statistical component, probably enacted via R. So beware of a major analytical or computational undertaking that is, nonetheless, not statistical (example: constructing a database). Creating useful data visualizations can be absolutely vital and is arguably statistical, but your analysis should go beyond merely creating pretty pictures (but please do include some!). Key concepts, at least some of which should come up in your analysis:\nthe (hypothesized, probably artificial) data-generating model\nbackground variation, variance, signal to noise ratio, estimates and their associated standard error\nrelationship between biological factors and experimental factors, apparent relative importance in terms of “explaining” observed data\nattention to large-scale inference, e.g. control of family-wise error rate or false discovery rate\nData considerations\nAppropriate use of data\nIf your project involves using unpublished data, ensure your plans are known to the data providers (e.g., your supervisors), and think about implications for publishing - are you are bringing the project team in as collaborators in effect? Are you planning to publish the results of your project, and if so who will be the co-authors? It is best to deal with these questions at the outset of the project.\nPrivacy of project data\nThe projects are not made public (other than an oral presentation of your work in front of your classmates, which will be recorded and made available only to the teaching team and registered students in the course). The project report materials are loaded into GitHub, the secure site we use to manage the course. The course staff and instructors are the only people who have access to the project GitHub repo other than the other members of the project group. The data used can be uploaded to the project, but this can limited or omitted if there are special concerns about privacy etc. - it’s primarily the code and write-up about the results that needs to be provided for evaluation.\nYou can read Github’s security and privacy policies.\nGroup makeup\nGroups will be formed by the instructional team following the results of an in class survey, and posted in the Discussion repo. Groups will have a target size of 4 members. Groups will be formed with priority for diversity in terms of backgrounds. In practice, this probably means the team members come from a mix of programs/departments. We will try to honour requests for working with specific team mates, and you may come talk to us immediately after receiving group assignments if you’d like to make a change.\nDeliverables\nDetails and grading rubrics for each component of the final group project can be found on the Group project rubrics page.\nInitial Proposal (5%)\n\nProgress report (5%)\nFinal report (10%)\nOral presentation (10%) - A Detailed rubric can be found here\nIndividual report (10%)\n\n\n\n",

Since this course is based around statistical methods of high dimensional biology, we want you to review their methods of analyses and think about ways in which it could be improved/modified and the extent to which they are able to address their biological questions with their given data/analyses.\nPaper in question:\n“Heterozygous deletion of the autism-associated gene CHD8 impairs synaptic function through widespread changes in gene expression and chromatin compaction”.\nX Shi, C Lu, A Corman, A Nikish, Y Zhou, RJ Platt, I Iossifov, F Zhang, JQ Pan, NE SanjanaThe American Journal of Human Genetics, 110(10):1750-1768, 2023\nhttps://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(23)00317-8\nDeliverables and Rubric:\nPrepare a written Markdown file with your critique organized in four sections as described below, adhering to the word count limits (no more than 250 words for each section, or 1000 words total):\n1) A brief review of the goal, findings and conclusion of the paper - 250 word count limit (1 pt) \nWhat’s the biological problem (from abstract/introduction)? What did the authors do (introduction/methods)? Briefly, what are some of their key findings (results)? Taken together, what did the authors conclude from these results?\n2) A list (or mentioning) of the related datasets/databases and data types used in the study. In the case of datasets, provide some details of the data matrix and meta data - 250 word count limit (0.5 pt)\nWhat kind of dataset was used/generated in this study? How was it generated? What does the dataset represent (i.e. groups, conditions, timepoints, cell types, mouse strains)?\n3) A brief review of the analytical steps in the paper with more details on some selected parts which are relevant to the course materials. You don’t need to understand all of the analysis, but should be able to identify the key analysis/method used to answer the question the paper is intended to answer - 250 word count limit (1.5 pt)\nWhat kinds of statistical analyses were used on this dataset? How do they control for variation between/within groups?\n4) Some comments and critiques about the analytical steps, alternative suggestions or improvements - 250 word count limit (2 pt)\nThis is where you add your own opinions on their methods. Do you agree with how they interpreted their findings? Do you see any gene function/network analyses? Do you see any limitations with their approach?\nGeneral Tips:\nWhere should I start?\nRead the title and abstract. Try to identify:\nThe biological problem that the authors are trying to address\nThe biological model they are using to address this problem\nThe datasets/methods they are using\nThe main finding of the paper\nRead through the introduction:\nWhat’s the biology of the system?\nWhat kind of model are they using?\nWhat’s the point of this study?\nWhat do they want to know? (e.g. expression of select genes, methylation, transcription factor binding sites?)\nBriefly look at the methods:\nIt will look like a jumble of text if you are not familiar with the techniques here. Try to understand what kind of models were being used (human, mouse, llama?), what technique was conducted to generate their dataset (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, WGBS, microarray?), what statistical methods were used on this dataset (clustering, FDR-cutoffs, ANOVA?).\nRead through the results:\nWhat is being compared? (i.e. condition A vs condition B)\nWhat were some of the key results that were found? (ex. what genes were identified? What do these genes do?)\nHow does this relate back to the biology? (i.e. how does this relate to the question that was being asked?)\nBriefly understand the discussion:\nHow did the authors interpret these findings? Do you agree with this?\nHere’s another helpful resource on how to read a research paper.\n\n\n\n",

Is STAT 540 for me?\n\n\nRegistration\nWhen is the course offered?\nJanuary-April of each academic year.\nI am not in one of the three cross-listed grad programs (STAT/BIOF/GSAT), but I would like to take this course. Can you grant me permission to register?\nThis course is primarily aimed at graduate students from three grad programs: STAT (Statistics), BIOF (Bioinformatics), and GSAT (Genome Sciences and Technology), and will not allow other students to register without permission. This is because the course is a recommended elective for these degree programs. As the course has become increasingly popular with students from other grad programs, we maintain a waitlist. We invite you to register for the waitlist as soon as possible, as we fill any available seats not occupied by STAT/BIOF/GSAT students from the waitlist (first-come, first-served) close to the start of the term.\nI am on the waitlist. Will I get a spot in the course?\nIf there are seats available, we will fill them from the waitlist (first-come, first-served) close to the start of the term. If there are no seats available, unfortunately we are not able to increase the class capacity.\nCan I audit the course?\nIf there’s a seat available for you, then yes! Unfortunately, you’ll still have to join the waitlist if you’re not a STAT/BIOF/GSAT student. Auditing still counts as a seat in the class, so auditing is not a way around the course capacity. Auditors are expected to complete all coursework (pass/fail) except the final project.\nCan I just ‘sit in’ the course without enrolling?\nUnfortunately not. Besides room capacity constraints, we just don’t have enough human resources (instructors, TAs) to accommodate students who are not registered. But you are still welcome to check out all the lecture notes, seminar worksheets, and resources freely available on this website!\nPrerequisites\nI have a strong background in biology, and am proficient in R, but have only had one university-level statistics course. Is STAT 540 for me?\nYes! None of us is an expert in all areas. This course is designed for those who have at least some entry-level experience in statistics, biology, and programming, but it is expected that each student will have differing degrees of strength across these areas. This is actually ideal for the group project, since we form teams with complementary areas of expertise.\nI have a strong background in statistics, am proficient in R, but haven’t taken any biology or genetics courses. Is STAT 540 for me?\nYes! See previous question :)\nI have never used R before. Is STAT 540 for me?\nIf you have some background in statistics and/or biology, then it could be! But be prepared for a steep learning curve with a lot of self-guided learning, especially if you don’t have experience with other programing languages.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nContents\nProject contribution multiplier\nInitial Proposal talk and proposal (5 pts)\nProgress report (5 pts)\nFinal report (10 pts)\nOral presentation (10 pts)\nIndividual report (10 pts)\n\nThis page contains more specific instructions for each project deliverable as well as their point values for grading. Each point represents 1 percent of total course grade; i.e. since the final project represents 40% of the final grade, you can think of each point as a percentage of the final grade. Ensure your repo is organized from the start so the TAs can easily find your work for marking.\nProject contribution multiplier\nThis rubric is for assessing a student’s contribution in the project components. This multiplier may be invoked on any or all of the project components. The multiplier is determined by the student’s contribution to the project. The contribution is assessed by the teaching team based on the student’s participation in the project, the quality of their work, and their interactions with their team members. This rubric is adapted from the UBC Master of Data Science grading rubric for projects.\n\nSolid contribution (1.0)\n\n\nThe member whole-heartedly contributed to the project (e.g., meaningful GitHub commits, active communication and participation). Overall, the team member fully met the expectations of their teammates and the teaching team.\n\n\nMinor issues (0.9)\n\n\nThe member has significant contributions in the project (e.g., meaningful GitHub commits, active participation in labs). The member mostly met the expectations of their team-mates and the teaching team with 1 to 2 exceptions. Some example exceptions include being late on completing tasks, writing with grammatical errors, not communicating with team members.\n\n\nSome issues (0.8)\n\n\nThe member has reasonable contributions in the project (e.g., meaningful GitHub commits, active participation in labs). The member more or less met the expectations of their teammates and the teaching team with 3 to 5 exceptions. Some example exceptions include erroneous work, doing or redoing other team member’s tasks without clear communication, or being late on finishing tasks.\n\n\nMultiple issues (0.7)\n\n\nThe member has some contributions in the project but only met a few expectations of the team mates and the teaching team. The team mates were not able to rely on them to complete tasks.\n\n\nNo contribution (0.5)\n\n\nThe member has very minimal positive contributions in the project (e.g., only a few commits). They failed to take responsibility and relied on other team mates to complete the project. The member’s contribution were more destructive than constructive (e.g., corrupting work done by other team members, doing or redoing other team member’s tasks without clear communication, repeatedly violating academic integrity policies).\n\n\nDestructive contribution (0.0)\n\n\nThe member has no positive contributions in the project. The member’s contribution were more destructive than constructive (e.g., corrupting work done by other team members, doing or redoing other team member’s tasks without clear communication, repeatedly violating academic integrity policies)\n\nInitial Proposal talk and proposal (5 pts)\nYour group will prepare a short written project proposal as a Markdown\nfile called initial_project_proposal.md, adhering to the word count\nlimits below. Add a link to this file in your main group repo\nREADME.md file so the TAs can easily find your work for\nmarking. This is a group-level deliverable (one submission per team).\n\n\n\nRubric: Marks will be based on effective communication of the main ideas of the following four aspects:\nBackground/Motivation - limit 300 words (1 point)\nWhat is already known in the context of this study?\n\nQuestion/Hypothesis - limit 250 words (2 points)\nWhat is the knowledge gap you are trying to fill?\nWhat do you expect to find?\n\nData - limit 200 words (1 point)\nDescribe the content and source of the data you will use?\nIf using previously published data, how will your project differ from previous literature?\n\nAnalysis Plan - limit 250 words (1 point)\nHow will you answer your main research question?\nHow will you distribute the work among your team members?\n\nProgress report (5 pts)\nYour group progress report will be a Markdown document called progress_report.md. Add a link to this file in your main group repo README.md file so the TAs can easily find your work for marking.\nWhat has changed based on the final proposal (1 pt.)\nDid your dataset change? If so, why?\nHave you decided to do a different analysis than what was mentioned in your proposal? If so, Why?\nAre there any changes in task assignments of group members?\nWhat is the progress of the analyses (2 pts.)\nSince your initial proposal, you should have decided more concretely on what methods to use for each step of your analyses, and employed some of those methods.\nBriefly and concisely explain your methodology and progress for the aims you have investigated so far. Which parts were modified and which parts remained the same?\nWhat R packages or other tools are you using for your analyses? You do not need to provide your scripts in your report.\nProvide the links to any markdown reports within your repo to refer to the relevant analysis.\nProvide references.\nResults (2 pts.)\nWhat are your primary results?\nWere you able to answer your hypothesis? Did you have any positive results? If no, postulate a discussion as to why that may be. Provide plots and/or tables to present your results.\nList some challenges that you have encountered or anticipate. How will you address them?\nFinal report (10 pts)\nThis is the final state of your group project repo, including your final written report summarizing your results, all analysis code, and presentation slides. It should contain the materials (or associated live links) an instructor would need to evaluate your work and that a group member would need to reproduce/reuse/extend the work. This is a group-level deliverable.\nWritten report (5 pts)\nThink of it as a technical report of your presentation that includes analysis and results. This should generally be GitHub Markdown output of your key statistical results generated from R Markdown analyses. Be sure to:\nInclude text throughout explaining the aim and main conclusions of each part.\nMake sure your code is readable, documented, and could be run by instructors. Make sure you are addressing the important files, such as “inputs” (e.g. links to the dataset(s) you analyzed) and “outputs” (e.g. figures). Provide valid links for the files you use in your scripts. Link to the report in your main README file.\nYou can find the full detailed rubric for evaluation of the written report here.\nGitHub repository organization (5 pts.)\nDetailed rubric here. Organizing your project files logically and consistently will help your team and the instructors to keep track of them. One best practice is to create subdirectories for different parts of your analyses. For example:\nsrc: contains source code (e.g .R files)\nresults: contains summary figures and/or reports (e.g. .pdf or html files)\npresentation: contains presentation slides files\nreports: contains the project proposal and progress report deliverables\nThe README.md file in the root directory of your the group repo should contain the summary of your project content/main results, and links to all deliverables.\nProvide a README.md file for each subdirectory to summarize its contents and analyses. Your project instructors should be able to go through all of your work just by following your README.md file(s). You can include a flow chart if you find it useful. Keep it brief and concise.\nYou may include any other directories you find helpful.\nExample:\n\n\n\nFor lots more detail and discussion on project organization and research computing, see this article.\nPresentation slides submission\nYour presentation slides files (e.g. presentation.PPTX or presentation.pdf or presentation.html) should be placed in your group repo. If your slides require extra files (e.g. if you used Rmd or Latex), create a subdirectory for those materials. Please provide a link to your final presentation slides in your group repo README.md. This is a group-level deliverable and is due with your final report (but is marked as part of your oral presentation).\nOral presentation (10 pts)\nPresentation sessions\nEach group will prepare one 20 minute oral presentation, which will be followed by a Q&A period of 5-10 minutes. We will have oral presentation sessions on the last four scheduled lecture sessions. Assignments for presentation dates will be posted on Canvas. Groups may choose to present synchronously (live), or prerecord their presentation and play the video during their presentation slot. This is a group-level deliverable, and all group members should participate, and be present during the presentation even if prerecorded so they can answer questions. In addition, each individual will randomly be assigned 2 other group presentations to peer review (see Individual report), so be sure to be present during the other presentation days as well.\nResources for pre-recording presentations: If you choose to prerecord your group presentation, you may do so using a variety of tools. One option is to record during a group meeting using Microsoft Teams or Zoom. Another option is to record in Powerpoint. You could also use screencast software such as QuickTime for Mac. If you need advice (or have advice to share) on recording/editing software for your system, please post in the Discussion repo.\nPresentation evaluation\nYour oral presentation is evaluated in 4 major categories:\nBackground/introduction (2 points)\nStatistical analysis (3 points)\nQuality of presentation (2 points)\nScientific maturity (3 points)\nYou can find the full detailed rubric for presentation evaluation in each of these categories here.\nIndividual report (10 pts)\nA one-page individual report as individual_report.md is an individual deliverable and should be in an individual private repository (it will have its own invitation link on Canvas). The report includes:\nPeer evaluation (2 pts)\nYou will be randomly assigned to provide peer feedback for two (2) oral presentations from other teams.\nFollowing the presentations, please review and provide constructive feedback using the 4-component Reflect Inquire Suggest Elevate (RISE) model of peer feedback. Include a statement/question for each of the 4 RISE components.\nPlease copy and paste each of your peer reviews in the Piazza #peer-review channel (so that the teams can receive your feedback), and include links to these messages in this report.\nA concise summary of contributions of each group member (1 pts)\nDescribes the tasks and contributions of each of your group members\nDo you think the task assignments were fairly assigned and appropriate given each member’s background and skills? If no, how would you change it?\nYour specific contributions and comments (1 pts)\nExplain what are your contributions to the project?\nWhat worked well and what did not? What was the most challenging or rewarding moment during your group project?\nHow did you find having members of different backgrounds for a scientific project?\nWhat have you learned from this group project?\nAny other comments on how the group project could have been structured differently (i.e. delivery requirements, assessment)\nWould you like to share your presentation? (1 pt)\nThanks to your feedback, we would like to make project presentation slides available to future students with your consent. Indicate which of the following statements is true (mark in this section is for completion; you will earn 1 point as long as you include one of these statements):\n\nI consent to sharing of my team’s final presentation slides on the course website for the benefit of future enrolled students as well as potential students.\n\n\nI consent to sharing of my team’s final presentation slides via Canvas for the benefit of future enrolled students only.\n\n\nI do not consent to sharing of my team’s final presentation slides with anyone.\n\nNote that slides will only be shared on the course website if all individuals in your team provide consent level a. Likewise, slides will only be shared on Canvas if all individuals in your team provide consent level a or b. If at least one person in the team selects option c (or does include a statement at all), your slides will not be shared with anyone. Note also that if you have used data that is not publicly available, it is your responsibility to first obtain consent from the data custodian if you choose option a or b.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nHow to start and submit assignments through GitHub and Gradescope\nYou need to have Git installed on your computer, and have a GitHub account. You can use command line Git or RStudio itself to push, pull, etc. to/from GitHub. See Seminar 1 for an illustrated setup guide and illustration of the full workflow from accepting an assignment to submission.\nStart a new assignment\nAccept: Click on the assignment invitation link for the assignment in Canvas. Each individual assignment/deliverable will have its own link, whereas the group project will only have one link at the start of the project (all deliverables will use the same shared repository). After you accept the assignment, a GitHub repository will be automatically be generated for you.\nClone the repository to your local machine (see Seminar 1 for illustration of this workflow). Now you can begin working on your submission files locally. See below for more detail on repositories and organizing files.\nHow to “turn in” your work: Save, Commit, Push, Submit\nFollow these steps carefully, and be sure they are complete before the deadline of each deliverable. Important Note: the deadline is automated, so you will not be able to perform a late submission (even by one second). Make sure to allow plenty of time for submission!\nPlease include a link to your assignment repository at the top of your main output file.\nSave all the files associated with your solution locally (i.e. for coding assignments R Markdown, GitHub Markdown, and any associated output files - see below for more detail).\nCommit those files to your local Git repository.\nPush the current state of your local repo to your private repo on GitHub. Double check that this was successful, by viewing your repo on GitHub to verify that the most recent commits are visible.\nSubmit the repository on Gradescope via the link in Canvas.\nThat’s it! You can commit/push to update your assignment as often as you’d like before the deadline (frequent commits are actually encouraged). A snapshot of your repo at the deadline will automatically be captured for grading.\n\nIf you’re concerned that something hasn’t gone right with the submission and the deadline is imminent, send the TAs an e-mail with your assignment attached. Note: this is only a last-minute emergency back-up plan, and penalties may apply. We will work with you until you get it submitted via GitHub/Gradescope.\n\nFiles & organization\nIndividual assignments\nUse the repositories that are automatically generated for you when you accept each assignment (e.g., the repo with the format STAT540-UBC-2024/seminar-01-yourGitHubID will contain your Seminar 1 deliverable). Do not use additional branches or any other repositories to submit your course work.\nAll your work for each deliverable should be nicely organized in its repository.\nYour repositories should include a README.md file with a clear description. These are like each assignment’s landing page.\nGroup project\nA shared team repository will be created for your group project; all group-level project deliverables will be submitted in this repo.\nInformation on organizing this repo can be found on the Group Project Rubrics Page\nMain required file types\nIn general for coding assignments, you need to commit and push your R Markdown, GitHub Markdown, and any associated figure/output files with your assignments (note: you should not to commit raw data to your repository - see below). Writing assignments are the exception (e.g. paper critique, project proposal): a Markdown file sufficient.\n\nThis workflow is specific to STAT 540 and may not necessarily reflect your workflow in other contexts.\n\nR Markdown (source file)\nWrite your homework in R Markdown. The file extension should be .Rmd.\nRecommendation: For coding assignments, start with the Markdown or R Markdown file that creates the assignment itself! You can take some things away (unnecessary detail) and add others (R chunks, explanatory text) to morph this into your homework solution.\nGitHub Markdown (output file)\nCompile your homework to GitHub Markdown (file extension should be .md).\nIn the YAML header, specify output: github_document as shown below\nRStudio’s “Knit” button will create the GitHub Markdown file (.md) when the output is specified in this way. The Github Markdown file is a file that can be rendered nicely on GitHub.\n\n---\ntitle: \"Homework assignment\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\noutput: github_document\n---\n\nNever ever edit the output Markdown “by hand”. Only edit the R Markdown source and then regenerate the downstream products from that.\nFigure files (output files)\nBy default, any figures created by your .Rmd are placed into a subdirectory titled [filename]_files where [filename] is the basename (without extension) of your .Rmd file.\nThe GitHub Markdown file links to these figure files and, therefore, requires these files to be present to in order to include the figures in your full report.\nFiles not to commit: Data files (input files)\nLocally, you may keep input data files in some logical place within the assignment’s directory. But list the names of such data files in your top-level .gitignore file, so that Git ignores it. Or better yet, include commands that download the data directly (if available and not too large). This is to reduce storage required on GitHub and when the TAs download your repositories for marking.\nGeneral tips for working on the assignments\nStart early. Even if you are already fluent with all the seminar materials, it will still take time to answer all the questions, and prepare files for submission.\nCommit early; commit often (and push). It’s helpful to have an earlier version of your work to return to (e.g. to debug if something suddenly throws an error and you can’t figure out why 🤯, or if your cat walks on your keyboard and deletes your repo 🤷).\nWhen you get stuck or when you run into an error, ask yourself these questions:\nAm I in the right working directory ?\nIs this material covered in one of the lectures or seminars?\nCan I google how to do this?\nIs there an R package that can more efficiently do what I’m attempting now?\nAm I using the right parameters for this function? (hint, type ?function_name() where function_name is the name of the function, to check if you’re using it right)\n\nYour Rmarkdown can’t be knitted? Is it because you didn’t define all the variables inside your Rmarkdown? Your code chunk might run in RStudio if all the variables are all defined in the RStudio environment, but it wouldn’t run as the Rmarkdown is being knitted if the variables aren’t defined in the Rmarkdown document.\nOverall presentation and mechanics refer to the fluency, neatness, easiness to read. For example:\nExplain what you’re doing to show your understanding, i.e. sandwiching your code and result with some explanations and interpretation. We don’t want to see just a graph or some R outputs standing alone in a question.\nUse headings/subheadings to distinguishes different sections/questions\nWell-structured dataframes and reusable functions can often lighten your work load and increase readability of code.\nUse inline R code whenever you refers to the value of a variable in a block of text.\nComment on your code so that everyone, including yourself, can easily follow through your steps. In R, comment follows the number sign. For example # What I did here\nConsider formating R output in a nice table instead of just printing it (e.g. see the kable() function from knitr package)\n\nYou might find cheatsheets from Rstudio useful, in terms of graphing, making an awesome R markdown, etc.\nMake it easy for others to run your code\nIn exactly one, very early R chunk, load any necessary packages, so your dependencies are obvious.\nIn exactly one, very early R chunk, import anything coming from an external file. This will make it easy for someone to see which data files are required, edit to reflect their locals paths if necessary, etc. There are situations where you might not keep data in the repo itself. Ideally, include commands to download if it is available and not too large.\nPretend you are someone else. Clone a fresh copy of your own repo from GitHub, fire up a new RStudio session and try to knit your R markdown file. Does it “just work”? It should!\n\n\n\n\n",

While you may have some background in one or more of the following areas, you are not expected to be an expert in all. That said, to be successful in the course, you may need to spend a bit more time in the areas that you have less experience in. Although there are no official prerequisites for the course, here is a list of useful skills to bring into the course and/or learn along the way.\nStatistics:\nYou should have already taken a university level introductory statistics course.\nThis free online book “Modern Statistics for Modern Biology” by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber is a great reference for introduction or review of many of the statistical concepts that are relevant for this course.\nThis free online book “Data Analysis for the Life Sciences” by Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love is another great resource for introduction or review of many of the statistical concepts relevant in this course, with an emphasis on implementation in R.\nBiology:\nNo requirements, but you are expected to learn things like, e.g. the difference between DNA and RNA, and the difference between a gene and a genome.\nSee this video and this slideset for some basic introductory material.\nGo through the (optional, not for a grade) molecular biology quiz on Canvas\nThis free online book “Concepts of Biology” by Fowler, Roush & Wise is a great resource for biological concepts, in particular chapters 6 and 9\nThis free online book “Biology” by Clark, Douglas & Choi goes more in-depth, see Chapters 14, 15, and 16 for material on genetics that is particularly relevant for this course.\nNo matter your prior experience, when you come across a new biological concept during the course or in your research, you might need to spend a bit of time ‘learning as you go’ - this is expected and something I still do regularly in my day-to-day research!\nR:\nNo experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning if you haven’t taken other courses on R or used it in your research.\nStart now by installing R and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED “integrated development environment” (IDE) RStudio - both are free and open source.\nYou should be able to run R on your own computer during each seminar session.\nIf you are new to R, check out this blog post on getting started with R.\nThis free online book “Introduction to Data Science” by Rafael Irizarry is also a great resource for getting more in-depth with R, programming basics, and the tidyverse. In particular see Chapters 1-5:\nChapter 1: Getting Started with R and R Studio\nChapter 2: R Basics\nChapter 3: Programming Basics\nChapter 4: The tidyverse\nChapter 5: Importing data\n\nGit/GitHub and R Markdown:\nIn this course we’ll be using the version control software Git and its web-based hosting and collaborative platform GitHub.\nThe online resource “Happy Git and GitHub for the useR” from Jenny Bryan is a great reference for these tools as we learn them.\nAnother helpful git resource is Hadley Wickham’s webinar “Collaboration and time travel- version control with git, github and RStudio”\nWe’ll learn about using R markdown to generate readable and reproducible reports with code and text, and you’ll be using that a lot in this course - see Chapter 18 of the ‘Happy Git’ resource: “Test drive R markdown”.\nEvaluation\nYou will have three individual assignments, six seminar submissions (one divided into two parts), and one group project. Deadlines are all by 11:59 pm (Pacific time) on the due date. Any submission or modification after the due date will not be graded unless you have requested an extension. If you anticipate having trouble meeting a deadline and need to request an extension/academic concession please reach out in advance via email to the instructors.\nFor more detail on each of these assignments, see the assignments page (the header of each assignment on this page points to the relevant section of the assignments page). Also refer to this visual overview of the timeline.\nFor detailed instructions on how to work and submit assignments for this course, please see the Submission Guide.\nIntro Assignment (5%)\nAn introductory assignment designed to assess basic knowledge of GitHub, R and Rmarkdown\n\nAssignment\nDue Date\nIntro Assignment\nSun 11 January 2026\n\nSeminar completion (30%)\nYou will submit short “deliverables” for each seminar session\nEach seminar session is weighted equally, but the lowest score will be dropped.\nThese deliverables give practical experience applying the knowledge that will be helpful on assignments, the project, and your future research.\nEach deliverable is due on the next Tuesday following the TA-led session for that seminar.\n\nCategory\nAssignment\nDate\nSeminar\nSeminar 1\nTue Jan 06\nSeminar\nSeminar 2a & 2b\nTue Jan 13\nSeminar\nSeminar 3\nTue Jan 20\nSeminar\nSeminar 4\nTue Jan 27\nSeminar\nSeminar 5\nTue Feb 03\nSeminar\nSeminar 6\nTue Feb 17\nSeminar\nSeminar 7\nTue Feb 24\nSeminar\nSeminar 8\nTue Mar 03\n\nPaper critique (5%)\nSee here for detailed instructions and rubric.\n\nAssignment\nDate\n\nAnalysis assignment (20%)\nInvolves detailed analysis of real data using R\nThis assignment will assess your ability to understand and apply the methods learned in class\n\nAssignment\nDate\n\nGroup project (40%)\nA semester-long data analysis group project where you will apply the techniques covered in class to a research question of your choosing\nGroups of target size of 4 students will be formed at the beginning of the course\nImportant checkpoints during the term (with deliverables):\nInitial Proposal\nFinal Proposal\nProgress Report\nOral presentation\nWritten Report & GitHub repository\nIndividual and Group Evaluation\n\nFor more details on the project components and how groups are selected see the assignments page\nParticipation in group projects is assessed via a contribution multiplier - see the multiplier rubric for details.\nFor detailed grading rubrics of the final project components, see the final project rubric page and the final project presentation rubric\n\nAssignment\nDate\n\nAcademic Concession\nIf you anticipate having trouble meeting a deadline and need an academic concession, please reach out in advance via email to the instructors. Here is a template you can use for a self-declaration.\nIf you miss class, we suggest you to:\nConsult the class resources on the course website\nUse the class Piazza discussion board to discuss missed material\nCome to virtual office hours\nSeek academic concessions, if applicable\nAcademic Integrity\nNot only is academic integrity is essential to the successful functioning of our course, but adopting best practices will benefit you in your research practice. Make sure you understand UBC’s definitions of academic misconduct and its consequences. Policy guidelines can be found here.\nWhat is academic integrity?\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work; nor should you help others to do the same. For example, it is prohibited to: share your past assignments and answers with other students; work with other students on an assignment when an instructor has not expressly given permission; or spread information through word of mouth, social media, websites, or other channels that subverts the fair evaluation of a class exercise, or assessment.\nWhat does academic integrity look like in this course?\nDo your own work. All individual work that you submit should be completed by you and submitted by you. Do not receive or share completed coursework with students who take the course in another term.\nAcknowledge others’ ideas. Scholars build on the work of others, and give credit accordingly. You are expected to acknowledge the use of any outside sources (e.g. from the literature, or AI tools) or inside sources (e.g from your peers).\nLearn to avoid unintentional plagiarism. Visit the Learning Commons’ guide to academic integrity to help you organize your writing as well as understand how to prevent unintentional plagiarism.\nAt any time: if you are unsure if a certain type of assistance is authorized, please ask us.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools\nTools that use artificial intelligence algorithms trained on large datasets to generate content, such as ChatGPT, have become widely accessible (these are often referred to as “generative AI tools”). If you choose to use generative AI tools to complete coursework, you must disclose your use of them. This disclosure must be included at the top of the submission file for the assignment in which the generative AI tool was used. The disclosure should include the name of the tool and a brief description of how it was used.\nFurther, if you choose to use generative AI tools for coursework, you should be aware of the following:\nPrivacy implications: Information you input into some tools, along with some device data such as your IP address, may be sent to servers outside of Canada, which may put your intellectual property and/or personal information at risk. For more information, please refer to UBC’s Privacy Impact Assessment for generative AI tools.\nFalse or misleading information: Generative AI tools can produce biased, false or misleading content, because of the nature of the training datasets. They are designed to produce the most statistically plausible text result, not necessarily the correct one, and they cannot take responsibility for what they produce. You, on the other hand, must take responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of your written work: therefore, you should not consider the output of a generative AI tool to be reliable unless verified by information in scholarly sources, and the information included in your assignments must be found in and attributed to scholarly sources.\nUltimately, this course is designed to help students practice analytical skills, and investigate a well-reasoned scientific question. Using generative AI tools to produce entire written and coding assignments will stifle independent thinking and undermine development of these valuable skills. If you have questions around the acceptable or unacceptable use of generative AI tools, we encourage you to speak to the instructors.\nWhat happens when academic integrity is breached?\nViolations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred for consideration for academic discipline. Careful records are kept to monitor and prevent recurrences. Any instance of cheating or taking credit for someone else’s work, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can and often will result in at minimum a grade of zero for the assignment, and these cases will be reported to the Head of the Department of Statistics and Associate Dean Students of the Faculty of Science.\nPrivacy\nThis course requires students to work on github.com and submit work through the Gradescope platform. Please be advised that the material and information you put on GitHub will be stored on servers outside of Canada. Data used for these tools may not be protected, as they have not gone through a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and been identified as FIPPA compliant. When you access GitHub, you will be required to create an account. While this tool has a privacy policy, UBC cannot guarantee security of your private details on servers outside of Canada.

The most up-to-date information about cancellations will be posted on ubc.ca. Please check ubc.ca often during times when an extreme weather event could disrupt our course activities. Here is what you can expect in the event an in-person lecture or lab session is cancelled:\nDepending on the nature of the planned in-class activities, class may take place over Zoom (in this case, Zoom link will be posted on Canvas), or an alternate activity may be posted on Canvas for you to complete before the next scheduled class.
