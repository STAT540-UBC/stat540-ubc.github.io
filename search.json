If you anticipate having trouble meeting a deadline, or need to request an extension please reach out via email.\nFor detailed instructions on how to submit your work, see the submission instructions section on this page and for more tips on mechanics, see the assignment tips page. For full credit, the following needs be done before the deadline:\nCommit & push the necessary files (for coding assignments both the Rmd and Markdown output are required)\nOpen an issue in your private repo the the appropriate commit tagged (with commit link pointing to the folder containing submitted files - see instructions), and tag current TAs with @STAT540-UBC/current_tas\nTimeline Overview\nFor a visual summary, click here.\n\nAssignment\nDue Date\nCategory\nSeminar 1\nFri Jan 14\nSeminar\nSeminar 2a & 2b\nFri Jan 21\nSeminar\nIntro Assignment\nMon Jan 24\nIndividual Assignment\nProject Groups and Initial Proposal\nFri Jan 28\nGroup Project\nSeminar 3\nFri Jan 28\nSeminar\nSeminar 4\nFri Feb 04\nSeminar\nPaper Critique\nMon Feb 07\nPaper Critique\nFinalized Project Proposal\nFri Feb 11\nGroup Project\nSeminar 5\nFri Feb 11\nSeminar\nAnalysis Assignment\nMon Feb 28\nIndividual Assignment\nSeminar 7\nFri Mar 04\nSeminar\nProject Progress Report\nFri Mar 11\nGroup Project\nGithub Repo\nWed Mar 30\nGroup Project\nPresentation Day 1\nWed Mar 30\nGroup Project\nPresentation Day 2\nMon Apr 04\nGroup Project\nIndividual Report\nWed Apr 06\nGroup Project\nPresentation Day 3\nWed Apr 06\nGroup Project\n\nAssignment details\nIntro assignment (5%)\nThis assignment is designed to give you an introduction to your future assignments. Once you have completed it, you will have set-up for the class and have a better understanding of how to set up your repository, pushing files to GitHub, writing markdown, and using R to do simple analyses. Grade point values are listed in the assignment.\nGo to the intro assignment and start now!\nSeminar completion (10%)\nYou will submit short “deliverables” for six seminars: 1, 2 (split into two parts - Seminar 2a and 2b together count as one deliverable), 3, 4, 5, and 7. These deliverables give practical experience applying the knowledge that will be helpful on the homework assignment, final project, and (hopefully) your future research. Each of these six Seminar session deliverables is weighted equally, but the lowest score will be dropped (so that the 5 deliverables with highest score will each count for 2% of the final grade). Seminar deliverables are due on the Monday following the TA-led session for that seminar. See the Seminars page for the submission materials.\nPaper critique (5%)\nEach student should review and critique this paper:\nComparative Transcriptome Profiling of Human Foreskin Fibroblasts Infected with the Sylvio and Y Strains of Trypanosoma cruzi by Houston-Ludlam et al (2016)\nAim for a length of 500-700 words in your summary/report. The summary should include:\nA brief review of the goal, findings and conclusion of the paper. (1 pt)\nA list (or mentioning) of the related datasets/databases and data types used in the study. In the case of datasets, provide some details of the data matrix and meta data. (0.5 pt)\nA brief review of the analytical steps in the paper with more details on some selected parts which are relevant to the course materials. You don’t need to understand all of the analysis, but should be able to identify the key analysis/method used to answer the question the paper is intended to answer (1.5 pt)\nSome comments and critiques about the analytical steps, alternative suggestions or improvements. (2 pt)\nPlease see critique rubric for guidelines on this task. Here’s another helpful resource on how to read a research paper.\nDelivery: You should put your paper review files in your individual course repository in .md format (notice that you don’t need to write it in .Rmd since you are not going to have any R code in it). You could edit .md files directly from github and therefore can write your full report there, but can also write it in your RStudio and then push it to your repository.\nAnalysis assignment (30%)\nThis assignment will assess your understanding of the seminar and lecture materials. Start early because this assignment will take time to fully work through. Use the issues in the Discussion repo and the seminar time to ask questions. You will find most of the analysis workflow of the assignment in the seminar materials.\nThe questions and links to the dataset are avalable here.\nThe grade point values for each question are listed right in the assignment.\nFinal group project (50%)\nGeneral principles\nIdentify a biological question of interest and a relevant dataset. Develop and apply a statistical approach that allows you to use the dataset to answer the question.\nWe assume the biological question and data fall in the general area of high-throughput, large-scale biological investigations targeted by the course. Beyond that, it is wide open: methylation, SNPs, miRNAs, CNVs, RNA-Seq, CHiP-Seq, gene networks, … it’s fair game. Avoid a dataset that doesn’t have any/much quantitative data, i.e. contains only sequence or discrete data.\nNote that definitive answers are not necessarily expected. Rather, aim to provide a critical appraisal of the data, the analytical approach, and the results. You will have to handle the competing pressures to “get it right” and “get it done”. Shortcomings of the data, misfits between the data or the biological question and the statistical model, etc. are inevitable. Your goal is to identify such issues and discuss them critically, without becoming paralyzed. Demonstrate understanding of the statistical concepts and methods that are the foundation of your analytical approach.\nWe assume the analytical and computing task will have a substantial statistical component, probably enacted via R. So beware of a major analytical or computational undertaking that is, nonetheless, not statistical (example: constructing a database). Creating useful data visualizations can be absolutely vital and is arguably statistical, but your analysis should go beyond merely creating pretty pictures (but please do include some!). Key concepts, at least some of which should come up in your analysis:\nthe (hypothesized, probably artificial) data-generating model\nbackground variation, variance, signal to noise ratio, estimates and their associated standard error\nrelationship between biological factors and experimental factors, apparent relative importance in terms of “explaining” observed data\nattention to large-scale inference, e.g. control of family-wise error rate or false discovery rate\nData considerations\nAppropriate use of data\nIf your project involves using unpublished data, ensure your plans are known to the data providers (e.g., your supervisors), and think about implications for publishing - are you are bringing the project team in as collaborators in effect? Are you planning to publish the results of your project, and if so who will be the co-authors? It is best to deal with these questions at the outset of the project.\nPrivacy of project data\nThe projects are not made public (other than an oral presentation of your work in front of your classmates, which will be recorded and made available only to the teaching team and registered students in the course). The project report materials are loaded into GitHub, the secure site we use to manage the course. The course staff and instructors are the only people who have access to the project GitHub repo other than the other members of the project group. The data used can be uploaded to the project, but this can limited or omitted if there are special concerns about privacy etc. - it’s primarily the code and write-up about the results that needs to be provided for evaluation.\nYou can read Github’s security and privacy policies.\nGroup makeup\nGroups will be formed by the instructional team following the results of an in class survey, and posted in the Discussion repo. Groups will have a target size of 4 members. Groups will be formed with priority for diversity in terms of backgrounds. In practice, this probably means the team members come from a mix of programs/departments. We will try to honour requests for working with specific team mates, and you may come talk to us immediately after receiving group assignments if you’d like to make a change.\nDeliverables\nDetails and grading rubrics for each component of the final group project can be found on the Group project rubrics page.\nProject groups & Initial Proposal (0%)\nProposal (5%)\nProgress report (8%)\nGitHub repository (10%)\nOral presentation (20%) - A Detailed rubric can be found here\nIndividual report (7%)\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nGoal\nTo practice your ability to go through a paper, identify the biological problem that the authors want to address and critique how they chose to approach this question. Since this course is based around statistical methods of high dimensional biology, we want you to review their methods of analyses and think about ways in which it could be improved/modified and the extent to which they are able to address their biological questions with their given data/analyses.\nPaper in question:\nComparative Transcriptome Profiling of Human Foreskin Fibroblasts Infected with the Sylvio and Y Strains of Trypanosoma cruzi by Houston-Ludlam et al (2016).\nWhere do I start?\nRead the title and abstract. Try to identify:\nThe biological problem that the authors are trying to address\nThe biological model they are using to address this problem\nThe datasets/methods they are using\nThe main finding of the paper\nRead through the introduction:\nWhat’s the biology of the system?\nWhat kind of model are they using?\nWhat’s the point of this study?\nWhat do they want to know? (e.g. expression of select genes, methylation, transcription factor binding sites?)\nBriefly look at the methods:\nIt will look like a jumble of text if you are not familiar with the techniques here. Try to understand what kind of models were being used (human, mouse, llama?), what technique was conducted to generate their dataset (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, WGBS, microarray?), what statistical methods were used on this dataset (clustering, FDR-cutoffs, ANOVA?).\nRead through the results:\nWhat is being compared? (i.e. condition A vs condition B)\nWhat were some of the key results that were found? (ex. what genes were identified? What do these genes do?)\nHow does this relate back to the biology? (i.e. how does this relate to the question that was being asked?)\nBriefly understand the discussion:\nHow did the authors interpret these findings? Do you agree with this?\nDeliverables and Rubric:\nIn four sections, present:\n1) A brief review of the goal, findings and conclusion of the paper. (1 pt) \nWhat’s the biological problem (from abstract/introduction)? What did the authors do (introduction/methods)? Briefly, what are some of their key findings (results)? Taken together, what did the authors conclude from these results?\n2) A list (or mentioning) of the related datasets/databases and data types used in the study. In the case of datasets, provide some details of the data matrix and meta data. (0.5 pt)\nWhat kind of dataset was used/generated in this study? How was it generated? What does the dataset represent (i.e. groups, conditions, timepoints, cell types, mouse strains)?\n3) A brief review of the analytical steps in the paper with more details on some selected parts which are relevant to the course materials. You don’t need to understand all of the analysis, but should be able to identify the key analysis/method used to answer the question the paper is intended to answer. (1.5 pt)\nWhat kinds of statistical analyses were used on this dataset? How do they control for variation between/within groups?\n4) Some comments and critiques about the analytical steps, alternative suggestions or improvements. (2 pt)\nThis is where you add your own opinions on their methods. Do you agree with how they interpreted their findings? Do you see any gene function/network analyses? Do you see any limitations with their approach?\n\n\n\n",

Can you grant me permission to register?\nI am on the waitlist. Will I get a spot in the course?\nCan I audit the course?\nCan I just ‘sit in’ the course without enrolling?\n\nPrerequisites\nI have a strong background in biology, and am proficient in R, but have only had one university-level statistics course. Is STAT 540 for me?\nI have a strong background in statistics, am proficient in R, but haven’t taken any biology or genetics courses. Is STAT 540 for me?\nI have never used R before. Is STAT 540 for me?\n\n\nRegistration\nWhen is the course offered?\nJanuary-April of each academic year.\nI am not in one of the three cross-listed grad programs (STAT/BIOF/GSAT), but I would like to take this course. Can you grant me permission to register?\nThis course is primarily aimed at graduate students from three grad programs: STAT (Statistics), BIOF (Bioinformatics), and GSAT (Genome Sciences and Technology), and will not allow other students to register without permission. This is because the course is a recommended elective for these degree programs. As the course has become increasingly popular with students from other grad programs, we maintain a waitlist. We invite you to register for the waitlist as soon as possible, as we fill any available seats not occupied by STAT/BIOF/GSAT students from the waitlist (first-come, first-served) close to the start of the term.\nI am on the waitlist. Will I get a spot in the course?\nIf there are seats available, we will fill them from the waitlist (first-come, first-served) close to the start of the term. If there are no seats available, unfortunately we are not able to increase the class capacity.\nCan I audit the course?\nIf there’s a seat available for you, then yes! Unfortunately, you’ll still have to join the waitlist if you’re not a STAT/BIOF/GSAT student. Auditing still counts as a seat in the class, so auditing is not a way around the course capacity. Auditors are expected to complete all coursework (pass/fail) except the final project.\nCan I just ‘sit in’ the course without enrolling?\nUnfortunately not. Besides room capacity constraints, we just don’t have enough human resources (instructors, TAs) to accommodate students who are not registered. But you are still welcome to check out all the lecture notes, seminar worksheets, and resources freely available on this website!\nPrerequisites\nI have a strong background in biology, and am proficient in R, but have only had one university-level statistics course. Is STAT 540 for me?\nYes! None of us is an expert in all areas. This course is designed for those who have at least some entry-level experience in statistics, biology, and programming, but it is expected that each student will have differing degrees of strength across these areas. This is actually ideal for the group project, since we form teams with complementary areas of expertise.\nI have a strong background in statistics, am proficient in R, but haven’t taken any biology or genetics courses. Is STAT 540 for me?\nYes! See previous question :)\nI have never used R before. Is STAT 540 for me?\nIf you have some background in statistics and/or biology, then it could be! But be prepared for a steep learning curve with a lot of self-guided learning, especially if you don’t have experience with other programing languages.\n\n\n\n",

This is a group-level deliverable so you’d submit it by opening an issue in your group repo can call it “Progress report of [group name]”, and provide the revision SHA and tag the TAs and instructors who are mentors of your project by the due date.\nGitHub repository (10 pts)\nThis should contain the materials (or associated live links) an instructor would need to evaluate your work and that a group member would need to reproduce/reuse/extend the work. This is a group-level deliverable.\nGitHub organization (5 pts.)\nCreate subdirectories for different parts of your analyses. For example:\nsrc: contains source code (e.g .R files)\ndata: contains data - best practice to include subdirectories for raw and processed data\nresults: contains summary figures and/or reports (e.g. .pdf or html files)\npresentation: contains presentation slides files\nreports: contains the project proposal and progress report deliverables\nThe README.md file in the root directory of your the group repo should contain the summary of your whole work. This file should summarize the project content, your analysis, and main results. Add links as needed when you are elaborating on your analysis or results. Provide a README.md file for each subdirectory to summarize its contents and analyses. Your project instructors should be able to go through all of your work just by following your README.md file(s). You can include a flow chart if you find it useful. Keep it brief and concise.\nYou may include any other directories you find helpful.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nAnalysis and results (5 pts)\nThink of it as a technical report of your presentation. Add brief comments and text throughout explaining the aim and conclusions of each part. You do not need to talk about all the analysis you have done but make sure you are addressing the important files, such as “inputs” (e.g. the dataset(s) you analyzed) and “outputs” (e.g. plain text files of your key statistical results or PDFs of your main figures)\nMake sure your code is readable and could be run by instructors. So, it is necessary to provide valid addresses for the files you use in your scripts. Add comments for different chunks of your code and document it.\nThis is a group-level deliverable so please submit it before the deadline by opening an issue in your group repo can call it “Final GitHub repo of [group name]”, and provide the revision SHA and tag the TAs and instructors who are mentors of your project.\nOral presentation (20 pts)\nPresentation sessions\nEach group will prepare one 15 minute oral presentation, which will be followed by 3 minutes for questions. We will have oral presentation sessions on the last three scheduled lecture sessions. These sessions will be recorded (only made available to teaching team and registered students). Assignments for presentation dates will be posted in the Discussion repo. Groups may choose to present synchronously (live), or prerecord their presentation and play the video during their presentation slot. This is a group-level deliverable, and all group members should be present during the presentation even if prerecorded so they can answer questions. In addition, each individual will randomly be assigned 2 other group presentations to peer review (see Individual report), so be sure to be present during the other presentation days as well.\nResources for pre-recording presentations: If you choose to prerecord your group presentation, you may do so using a variety of tools. One option is to record during a group meeting using Microsoft Teams or Zoom. Another option is to record in Powerpoint. You could also use screencast software such as QuickTime for Mac. If you need advice (or have advice to share) on recording/editing software for your system, please post in the Discussion repo.\nPresentation evaluation\nYour oral presentation is evaluated in 4 major categories:\nBackground/introduction\nStatistical analysis\nQuality of presentation\nScientific maturity\nYou can find the full detailed rubric for presentation evaluation in each of these categories here.\nPresentation slides submission\nYour presentation slides files (e.g. presentation.PPTX or presentation.pdf or presentation.html) should be placed in the root of your group repo. If your slides require extra files (e.g. if you used Rmd or Latex), you can create a subdirectory for those materials. Please provide a link to your final presentation slides in your group repo README.md. This is a group-level deliverable so one of your group members should submit it by linking it in an issue with name “Presentation of [group name]”, and provide the revision SHA and tag the TAs and instructors who are mentors of your project by the due date (GitHub Repo due date).\nIndividual report (7 pts)\nA one-page individual report as individual_report.md should be in your individual private repository. It includes:\nPeer evaluation (2 pts)\nYou will be randomly assigned to provide peer feedback for two (2) oral presentations from other teams.\nFollowing the presentations, please review and provide constructive feedback using the 4-component Reflect Inquire Suggest Elevate (RISE) model of peer feedback. Include a statement/question for each of the 4 RISE components.\nPlease copy and paste each of your peer reviews as a discussion post in the discussion repo (so that the teams can receive your feedback), and include links to these posts in this report.\nA concise summary of contributions of each group member (2 pts)\nDescribes the tasks and contributions of each of your group members\nDo you think the task assignments were fairly assigned and appropriate given each member’s background and skills? If no, how would you change it?\nYour specific contributions and comments (3 pts)\nExplain what are your contributions to the project?\nWhat worked well and what did not? What was the most challenging or rewarding moment during your group project?\nHow did you find having members of different backgrounds for a scientific project?\nWhat have you learned from this group project?\nAny other comments on how the group project could have been structured differently (i.e. delivery requirements, assessment”)\nPlease provide a link to your individual_report.md file in your private repository README.md. This is not a group-level deliverable so every student should submit it by linking it in an issue with name “Individual report of [your private repository name]”, provide the revision SHA and tag the TAs by the due date.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Submission Guide",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nHow to work on and submit assignments through GitHub\nCourse work files & organization\nYou need to have Git installed on your computer. You can use command line Git or a Git client (such as GitHub Desktop), or even RStudio itself to push, pull, etc. to/from GitHub.\nSet-up your private GitHub repo to organize all your individual course work\nPlease use the repository within the organization assigned to you to submit all your course work (i.e., the repo zz_lastname-firstname_STAT540_2022). Do not use branches or any other repositories.\nAll your work should be nicely organized in your repository. Your repository needs to include a clear top-level README.md that contains links to your work. This is the presentation of your repository and it helps others to find your work and contributions!\nMake directories for each assignment type (e.g. Intro_Assignment, Paper_critique, Analysis_Assignment, Seminars, Project)\nWe simply mean a directory or “folder” – NOT a Git branch or anything fancy like that! On your local computer, go to the directory where this Git repository lives. Make the new directories here. Example:\n\n\n\n\n- These directories may have sub-directories (especially useful for the `Seminars` directory)\nIt is also recommended to include a README.md inside each of the assignment and seminar directories.\nGitHub automatically renders all Markdown files into (pseudo-)HTML when you visit them in a browser. Whenever a directory in a repo is visited, if it contains a Markdown file called README.md, it will automatically be rendered, effectively serving as a landing or home page.\n\nYou will also have a team repository for your group project; more information on organizing this repo (with similar principles) can be found on the Group Project Rubrics Page\nMain required file types\nIn general, these are the files you need to commit with your assignments. Note that you should not commit input data to your repository. Locally, you may keep the file in some logical place within the assignment’s directory. But list the names of such data files in your top-level .gitignore file, so that Git ignores it. Or better yet, include commands that download the data directly (if available and not too large). This is to reduce file sizes required when the TAs download your repositories for marking.\n\nThis is rather specific to STAT 540 and may not necessarily reflect your workflow in other contexts.\n\nR Markdown (source file)\nWrite your homework in R Markdown. The file extension should be .Rmd.\nRecommendation: Create a skeleton of your report by starting with the Markdown or R Markdown file that creates the assignment itself! You can take some things away (unnecessary detail) and add others (R chunks, explanatory text) to morph this into your homework solution.\nClick on “Raw” when viewing the file on GitHub to get raw Markdown and save to a local file.\n\nMarkdown (output file)\nCompile your homework to Markdown (file extension should be .md).\nIn the YAML header, specify output: github_document as shown below\nRStudio’s “Knit” button will create the md file when the output is specified in this way. The github .md file is a file that can be rendered nicely on GitHub.\n\n---\ntitle: \"Homework assignment\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\noutput: github_document\n---\n\nNever ever edit the output Markdown “by hand”. Only edit the R Markdown source and then regenerate the downstream products from that.\nFigure files (output files)\nNote that, by default, any figures created by your .Rmd are placed into a subdirectory titled [filename]_files where [filename] is the basename (without extension) of your .Rmd file.\nThe Markdown file links to these figure files and, therefore, requires these files to be present to in order to include the figures in your full report.\nHow to “turn in” your work\nWhen it’s time to turn in your deliverable, follow these steps carefully:\nSave, Commit, Push:\nSave all the files associated with your solution locally (R Markdown and Markdown files are both required for coding assignments).\nCommit those files to your local Git repository.\nPush the current state of your local repo to your private repo on GitHub.\n\nLink to the latest commit, open an issue, tag us:\nGrab the link to the latest commit:\nVisit your private GitHub repository in a web browser\nJust above the file list, click on the link to the list of commits in your repo\nClick on the SHA tag of the relevant commit (7 letters/numbers)\nClick ‘Browse files’\nNavigate to the folder containing the submitted files\nCopy the link in the address bar of your browser (this link points to the submitted files at the time of the relevant commit)\n\nOpen an issue:\nClick on “Issues”, then on “New Issue”\nPaste the link from step (i). in the body of the issue\nName the issue “Mark the deliverable title of your repository name”, e.g. “Mark seminar 1 of zz_lastname-firstname_STAT540_2022W2”\n\nTag us:\nIn the description of the issue, tag all TAs with the @STAT540-UBC/current_tas tag\nClick “Submit new issue”. You’re done! Congratulations!\n\n\nIf you’re concerned that something hasn’t gone right with the submission, send the TAs an e-mail with your assignment attached. Note: this is only an emergency back-up plan. We will work with you until you eventually get it submitted via GitHub.\n\nGeneral tips for working on the assignments\nStart early. Even if you are already fluent with all the seminar materials, it will still take time to answer all the questions, and prepare files for submission.\nCommit early; commit often (and push). It’s helpful to have an earlier version of your work to return to (e.g. to debug if something suddenly throws an error and you can’t figure out why; your computer crashes and you lose locally saved files).\nWhen you get stuck or when you run into an error, ask yourself these questions:\nAm I in the right working directory ?\nIs this material covered in one of the lectures or seminars?\nCan I google how to do this?\nIs there an R package that can more efficiently do what I’m attempting now?\nAm I using the right parameters for this function? (hint, type ?function_name() where function_name is the name of the function, to check if you’re using it right)\n\nYour Rmarkdown can’t be knitted? Is it because you didn’t define all the variables inside your Rmarkdown? Your code chunk might run in RStudio if all the variables are all defined in the RStudio environment, but it wouldn’t run as the Rmarkdown is being knitted if the variables aren’t defined in the Rmarkdown document.\nWell-structured dataframes and reusable functions can often lighten your work load and increase readability of code.\nOverall presentation and mechanics refer to the fluency, neatness, easiness to read. For example:\nUsing headings/subheadings to distinguishes different sections/questions\nExplain what you’re doing to show your understanding, i.e. sandwiching your code and result with some explanations and interpretation. We don’t want to see just a graph or some R outputs standing alone in a question.\nUse inline R code whenever you refers to the value of a variable in a block of text.\nComment on your code so that everyone, including yourself, can easily follow through your steps.\nIn R, comment follows the number sign. For example # What I did here\n\nThere are a few occasions where, instead of just printing an object with R, you could format the info in an nice table.\nThe kable() function from knitr package.\nAlso look into the packages xtable, pander for making pretty HTML tables.\n\nYou might find cheatsheets from Rstudio useful, in terms of graphing, making an awesome R markdown, etc.\nMake it easy for others to run your code\nIn exactly one, very early R chunk, load any necessary packages, so your dependencies are obvious.\nIn exactly one, very early R chunk, import anything coming from an external file. This will make it easy for someone to see which data files are required, edit to reflect their locals paths if necessary, etc. There are situations where you might not keep data in the repo itself. Ideally, include commands to download if it is available and not too large.\nPretend you are someone else. Clone a fresh copy of your own repo from GitHub, fire up a new RStudio session and try to knit your R markdown file. Does it “just work”? It should!\n\n\n\n\n",

It is expected that lecture and seminar will be held in person starting January 24. In case of any changes to this plan, stay tuned to UBC Broadcast communications.\nLectures held in person will also be live-streamed whenever possible (links shared in Canvas) to minimize disruption for those students who are unable to attend class due to illness or isolation. Seminar sessions will not be recorded, as these are primarily interactive.\nLectures (Sec 201)\nTime : Mon Wed 9:30 - 11am\nLocation:\nBefore January 24: online (Zoom meeting links posted in Canvas)\nOn January 24 and after: in person in ESB 2012\n\nSee Lectures for lecture materials and schedule\nSeminars (Sec S2B)\nTime : Mon 12pm - 1pm\nLocation:\nBefore January 24: online (Zoom meeting links posted in Canvas)\nOn January 24 and after: in person in ESB 1012\n\nSee Seminars for schedule and seminar materials\nWe strongly recommend reading the seminar materials prior to attending each seminar.\nCourse communication\nAs we begin the term with web-oriented learning, it is vital that we have a dedicated plan for how we will communicate throughout the semester.\nAnnouncements\nCourse announcements will be posted in the course Github Discussion repository (this will be changed to a private repo and you will be granted access after we collect your Github user IDs). You are responsible for checking it regularly (subscribe to email notifications for this repo to make this easier).\nGeneral questions\nPlease also use the course Github Discussion repository for posting questions (e.g. topics discussed in class, questions about course organization, assignment clarifications, if you are stuck on an assignment and need help). This ensures the message can be seen by the entire teaching team, and that others in the class who might have the same question can learn from responses. You are also welcome to share your input on questions posted by others using comments.\nPrivate matters\nFor private matters (e.g. requesting an extension or concerns about your grades), please contact the Teaching team by email (listed above). Please refrain from using email to ask general questions described above.\nGroup work\nIn your final project groups, we encourage you to make use of (1) the discussion feature in your GitHub Teams group, and (2) the issues feature in your group’s project repo. In addition, you are encouraged to meet regularly via an online platform of your choice (or in person if conditions permit). Please reach out if you have any questions or challenges in this space.\nPrerequisites and Resources\nThis interdisciplinary course requires a broad range of skills at the interface of statistics, molecular biology / genomics, and computing. While you may have some background in one or more of the following areas, you are not expected to be an expert in all. That said, to be successful in the course, you may need to spend a bit more time in the areas that you have less experience in. Although there are no official prerequisites for the course, here is a list of useful skills to bring into the course and/or learn along the way.\nStatistics:\nYou should have already taken a university level introductory statistics course.\nThis free online book “Modern Statistics for Modern Biology” by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber is a great reference for introduction or review of many of the statistical concepts that are relevant for this course.\nThis free online book “Data Analysis for the Life Sciences” by Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love is another great resource for introduction or review of many of the statistical concepts relevant in this course, with an emphasis on implementation in R.\nBiology:\nNo requirements, but you are expected to learn things like, e.g. the difference between DNA and RNA, and the difference between a gene and a genome.\nSee this video and this slideset for some basic introductory material.\nGo through the (optional, not for a grade) molecular biology quiz on Canvas\nThis free online book “Concepts of Biology” by Fowler, Roush & Wise is a great resource for biological concepts, in particular chapters 6 and 9\nThis free online book “Biology” by Clark, Douglas & Choi goes more in-depth, see Chapters 14, 15, and 16 for material on genetics that is particularly relevant for this course.\nNo matter your prior experience, when you come across a new biological concept during the course or in your research, you might need to spend a bit of time ‘learning as you go’ - this is expected and something I still do regularly in my day-to-day research!\nR:\nNo experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning if you haven’t taken other courses on R or used it in your research.\nStart now by installing R and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED “integrated development environment” (IDE) RStudio - both are free and open source.\nYou should be able to run R on your own computer during each seminar session.\nIf you are new to R, check out this blog post on getting started with R.\nThis free online book “Introduction to Data Science” by Rafael Irizarry is also a great resource for getting more in-depth with R, programming basics, and the tidyverse. In particular see Chapters 1-5:\nChapter 1: Getting Started with R and R Studio\nChapter 2: R Basics\nChapter 3: Programming Basics\nChapter 4: The tidyverse\nChapter 5: Importing data\n\nGit/GitHub and R Markdown:\nIn this course we’ll be using the version control software Git and its web-based hosting and collaborative platform GitHub.\nThe online resource “Happy Git and GitHub for the useR” from Jenny Bryan is a great reference for these tools as we learn them.\nAnother helpful git resource is Hadley Wickham’s webinar “Collaboration and time travel- version control with git, github and RStudio”\nWe’ll learn about using R markdown to generate readable and reproducible reports with code and text, and you’ll be using that a lot in this course - see Chapter 18 of the ‘Happy Git’ resource: “Test drive R markdown”.\nEvaluation\nYou will have three individual assignments, six seminar submissions (one divided into two parts), and one group project. Deadlines are all by 11:59 pm (Pacific time) on the due date, and late assignments are penalized 10% per day/partial day.\nFor more detail on each of these assignments, see the assignments page (the header of each assignment on this page points to the relevant section of the assignments page). Also refer to this visual overview of the timeline.\nFor detailed instructions on how to work and submit assignments using GitHub for this course, please see the Submission Guide.\nIntro Assignment (5%)\nAn introductory assignment designed to assess basic knowledge of GitHub, R and Rmarkdown\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nDue Date\n\n\nIntro Assignment\n\n\nMon 24 January 2022\n\n\nSeminar completion (10%)\nYou will submit short “deliverables” for seminars 1, 2 (split into two parts - Seminar 2a and 2b together count as one deliverable), 3, 4, 5, and 7\nEach of these six Seminar session deliverables is weighted equally, but the lowest score will be dropped (so that the 5 deliverables with highest score will each count for 2% of the final grade).\nThese deliverables give practical experience applying the knowledge that will be helpful on the homework assignment, final project, and (hopefully) your future research.\nEach deliverable is due on the Friday following the TA-led session for that seminar\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nDue Date\n\n\nSeminar 1\n\n\nFri 14 January 2022\n\n\nSeminar 2a & 2b\n\n\nFri 21 January 2022\n\n\nSeminar 3\n\n\nFri 28 January 2022\n\n\nSeminar 4\n\n\nFri 04 February 2022\n\n\nSeminar 5\n\n\nFri 11 February 2022\n\n\nSeminar 7\n\n\nFri 04 March 2022\n\n\nPaper critique (5%)\nRead, summarize and critique this paper\nFor detailed instructions, refer to the assignments page\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nDue Date\n\n\nPaper Critique\n\n\nMon 07 February 2022\n\n\nAnalysis assignment (30%)\nInvolves detailed analysis of real data using R\nThis assignment will assess your ability to understand and apply the methods learned in class\nFor more detailed instructions, see the assignments page and the markdown document with the questions\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nDue Date\n\n\nAnalysis Assignment\n\n\nMon 28 February 2022\n\n\nGroup project (50%)\nA semester-long data analysis group project that will allow you to apply the techniques covered in class to a research question of your choosing\nGroups of target size of 4 students will be formed at the beginning of the course\nImportant checkpoints during the term (with deliverables):\nInitial project proposal (one-paragraph)\nFinalize the one page project proposal\nProgress report\n15 minute oral presentation\nGitHub repository\nIndividual report deadline\n\nFor more details on the project components and how groups are selected see the assignments page\nFor detailed grading rubrics of the final project components, see the final project rubric page and the final project presentation rubric\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nDue Date\n\n\nProject Groups and Initial Proposal\n\n\nFri 28 January 2022\n\n\nFinalized Project Proposal\n\n\nFri 11 February 2022\n\n\nProject Progress Report\n\n\nFri 11 March 2022\n\n\nGithub Repo\n\n\nWed 30 March 2022\n\n\nPresentation Day 1\n\n\nWed 30 March 2022\n\n\nPresentation Day 2\n\n\nMon 04 April 2022\n\n\nIndividual Report\n\n\nWed 06 April 2022\n\n\nPresentation Day 3\n\n\nWed 06 April 2022\n\n\nAcademic Concession\nIf you anticipate having trouble meeting a deadline and need an academic concession, please reach out in advance via email to the instructors. Here is a template you can use for a self-declaration.\nAcademic Integrity\nNot only is academic integrity is essential to the successful functioning of our course, but adopting best practices will benefit you in your research practice. Make sure you understand UBC’s definitions of academic misconduct and its consequences. Policy guidelines can be found here.\nWhat does academic integrity look like in this course?\nDo your own work. All individual work that you submit should be completed by you and submitted by you. Do not receive or share completed coursework with students who take the course in another term.\nAcknowledge others’ ideas. Scholars build on the work of others, and give credit accordingly. This refers to both outside sources (e.g. from the literature), and inside sources (e.g from your peers).\nLearn to avoid unintentional plagiarism. Visit the Learning Commons’ guide to academic integrity to help you organize your writing as well as understand how to prevent unintentional plagiarism.\nAt any time: if you are unsure if a certain type of assistance is authorized, please ask us.\nVideo etiquette for online classes\nDuring online lecture and seminar sessions, please observe the following guidelines to help foster a productive learning environment:\nPlease keep your microphone muted when you aren’t speaking to minimize background noise\nTo minimize ‘Zoom fatigue’, you may keep your camera off when you are not speaking. If your environment is suitable and you feel comfortable doing so, please turn your camera on when speaking.\nPlease make use of the chat feature to ask questions or make comments - the TAs will be monitoring this space.\nPrivacy\nLecture streaming & recording\nZoom lectures, in person classroom video streams, and their recordings are only provided to students registered in the course. To protect the privacy of fellow students, please do not share these links or files with others.\nGitHub\nThis course requires students to work and communicate on github.com. Please be advised that the material you put on GitHub will be stored on servers outside of Canada.\nLearning Environment & Support\nWe strive to provide a learning environment where all students can succeed. Please join me in contributing to a classroom culture where everyone feels valued. If you encounter an issue that presents a barrier to your learning, please reach out to us. You can also contact the Ombudsperson for help: https://ombudsoffice.ubc.ca. If you have a documented disability that affects your learning, you may contact the UBC Centre for Acessibility: https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility, and contact us as soon as possible if you think you may require accommodation options for course work.\nYour mental health and wellbeing impacts your academic performance. Sometimes it is possible to manage challenges on your own, while other times you may need support. UBC is committed to providing student mental health and wellbeing resources, strategies, and services that help you achieve your goals. Visit https://students.ubc.ca/health for more information.\nCovid Safety in the Classroom\nMasks\nMasks are required for all indoor public spaces on campus, including classrooms, as per the BC Public Health Officer orders and UBC policy. For our in-person meetings in this class, it is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while sharing an indoor space. For the purposes of this order, the term “masks” refers to medical and non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths. Masks are a primary tool to make it harder for COVID-19 to find a new host. You will need to wear a medical or non-medical mask for the duration of our class meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class. Your mask should cover your nose and mouth. Please do not eat in class. If you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc, please keep your mask on between sips.\nStudents who need to request an exemption to the indoor mask mandate must do so based on one of the grounds for exemption detailed in the PHO Order on Face Coverings (COVID-19). Such requests must be made through the Center for Accessibility (info.accessibility@ubc.ca).\nMask wearing protects you as well as others in your environment. Let’s do everything we can as a community to stop the spread of this virus.\nVaccination\nIf you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against COVID-19, vaccines are available to you, free: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine. The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus. You are an important part of the UBC community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so. Please also arrange to receive your booster shot once you are eligible, to maximize your protection against emerging variants.\nSeating in class\nTo reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, please sit in a consistent area of the classroom each day. This will minimize your close contacts and will still allow for the pedagogical methods planned for this class to help your learning.\nYour personal health\nIf you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other).\nA daily self-health assessment is required before attending campus. Every day, before coming to class, complete the self-assessment for Covid symptoms using this tool: https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en\nDo not come to class if you have symptoms of COVID-19, have recently tested positive for COVID-19, or are required to self-isolate or quarantine. You can check this website to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who.\nIf you came to class prior to developing symptoms but later test positive for COVID-19, you are not required to inform your classmates. Public Health conducts contact tracing of positive COVID-19 cases to identify “close contacts”, and will identify and inform any individuals at risk.\nYour precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. In this class, the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed.\nWhat to do if you miss class due to self-isolation requirements or any illness:\nView streaming or recorded lectures, if available\nConsult the class resources on the course website\nUse the class Discussion repo on GitHub to carry out discussions\nCome to virtual office hours\nSeek academic concessions, as needed\nInstructor health\nIf we (the instructors or TAs) are sick: If one of us is ill, develops COVID-19 symptoms, or test positive for COVID-19, then we will not come to class on the days we are scheduled to teach. If that happens, here’s what you can expect:\nIf this happens on a day we are scheduled to be in person, and we are well enough to teach (most likely), we will still conduct online lectures through Zoom until we are well. In this case, we will post an announcement on the class Discussion repo on GitHub with information. You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last minute announcement. Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session, although it is recommended that you bring headphones.\nIf we are not well enough to teach, then either the other instructor (for the case of lectures), or the other TA (for the case of seminars), will try to be available to fill in. If not, we will try to make new resources to aid in your learning, or make accommodations regarding the assignments.\n\n\n\n",
