## Teaching Assistant

**Pronouns**: They/Them/Theirs

**Virtual office hours**: TBA

I am a Masters student in the Genome Science and Technology department at UBC. I completed my undergrad at UBC and BCIT in the Biotechnology program. My thesis project involves scaling up massively parallel reporter assays using density-based cell sorting. Outside of the lab, I like knitting and playing various musical instruments!
