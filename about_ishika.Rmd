## Teaching Assistant

**Pronouns**: She/Her/Hers
**Virtual office hours**: Friday 10-11am (PST) 

I am a PhD candidate in the Bioinformatics program at UBC. I completed my undergraduate degree from Simon Fraser University with a Bachelors of Applied Science in Biomedical Engineering in 2018. I am interested in using machine learning approaches to further our understanding of the genome. My thesis project involves using neural network models to predict gene expression from DNA sequence. In my free time I enjoy yoga, baking, hiking and skiing.
